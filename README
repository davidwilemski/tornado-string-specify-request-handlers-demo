A simple demo of loading RequestHandlers using strings that specify the fully qualified class name rather than importing a module and then passing the object.

The demo is based off of the Hello, World demo. The only differences are that I put the RequestHandler into a separate file inside of a sub directory to show that this works for sub directories of RequestHandlers as well.
